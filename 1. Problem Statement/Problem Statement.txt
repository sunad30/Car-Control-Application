PROBLEM STATEMENT

Remote Car Control Prototype Application
An Android App to control your car

DESCRIPTION

The aim of this project is to explore the capabilities of Android Studio to quickly develop mobile applications for a given purpose.
The chosen context is the creation of an app that allows the user to remotely control his/her connected car in order to:
- locate it
- lock/unlock the doors/trunk
- activate the air conditioner and define its temperature
- honk or activate the lights
- check its status (temperature, warnings, ...)

Although it is not meant to be used in a real-case scenario, the developed application passed the initial implementation phases, 
including a user evaluation executed in order to seek further improvement windows.
Final considerations for future work are also provided.
